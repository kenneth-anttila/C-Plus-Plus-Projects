/* 
The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:

Weight of Package (in Kilograms) Rate per 500 Miles Shipped

2 kg or less $1.10

Over 2 kg but not more than 6 kg $2.20

Over 6 kg but not more than 10 kg $3.70

Over 10 kg but not more than 20 kg $4.80

Write a program that asks for the weight of the package
and the distance it is to be shipped,
and then displays the charges.

Input Validation: Do not accept values of 0 or less for the
weight of the package. Do not accept weights of more than
20 kg (this is the maximum weight the company will ship).
Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more
than 3,000 miles. These are the companyâ€™s minimum and 
maximum shipping distances.*/
